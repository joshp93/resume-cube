# Resume cube
Here is a 3D cube you can interact with, written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, designed to demonstrate my ability as a front end dev. It also has links to some other fun projects which I have worked on.

## NB:
A word of caution... 3d animated elements can be very computationally expensive, janky and don't really confirm to animation standards for optimisation. Here there be dragons if ye choose to implement something like this for a production site. Obviously this is not particularly practical, however it's good fun to mess around with!
