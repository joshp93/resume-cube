A 3d spinning cube. Spoilers for Flash Gordon inside...

## Flash I love you but why are websites always 2d?

This is a demonstration of how to create 3d animated elements using pure css and html. It was written as part of a PD day at work.

A word of caution... 3d animated elements can be very computationally expensive, janky and don't really confirm to animation standards for optimisation. Here there be dragons if ye choose to implement something like this for a production site!
