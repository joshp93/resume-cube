                    I designed this app to get some feedback when giving presentations at my church. It is a similar
                    concept to Slido, but it visualises responses differently and stresses the fact that it doesn't
                    collect any data about the user other than their response.
                    <br>
                    This is written in Angular and uses Angular Material for the forms, buttons and inputs. It uses
                    Google's Firebase platform for Authentication and Database storage. On the visualisation page, data
                    is streamed in realtime from the Firestore database, so new responses can be seen as they come in.
                    <br>
                    I can provide a demo of this application on request.

                    I wrote an Angular app which integrates with Spotify's API to get listing trends
                    from the users account.
                    <br>
                    This is written in Angular, and as well as integrating with the API, this app uses the JavaScript
                    Audio API to
                    play previews of the tracks.

                    It's based on a game that I played as a kid, where you could run a small business catching and
                    selling lobsters. I want to extend it one day so that you can buy boats and go out to the deep

                    Written in Angular, this app will help you keep score when playing board games etc. It will randomly

                    I wrote this CRM system on request for CSN, a small charity, because I wanted to support their efforts.
                    They are now using this system fulltime and it is saving them hundreds of pounds a month. It is a
                    database of Second Contacts information which can be used for referrals.
                    <br>
                    The CRM system is written in Angular with Angular Material components. I designed a custom pallete
                    and colour theme for them based on their logo. It uses Google's Firebase for Authentication and Database storage.
