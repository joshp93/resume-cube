                    I wrote an Angular app which integrates with Spotify's API to get listing trends
                    from the users account.
                    <br>
                    This is written in Angular, and as well as integrating with the API, this app uses the JavaScript
                    Audio API to
                    play previews of the tracks.

                    This be a game I made to showcase me love for pyrates (and also me ability to

                    <br>
                    It's based on a game that I played as a kid, where you could run a small business catching and
                    selling lobsters. I want to extend it one day so that you can buy boats and go out to the deep

                    Written in Angular, this app will help you keep score when playing board games etc. It will randomly
